# Identical-sensors
General comment: To better understand the problem, please read my paper published in Transportation Research Part B:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261518307288


The programs in this file is for the use of identical sensors. (Identical sensors: have the same cost and the same probability of failure.




1-To run the program, copy and paste all this file containment in a folder and set this folder as the path in MATLAB.
2-The main program are named "MainGA1UsingAverageObservedIneachEquation" and "mainGAwsm".
3-In both programs, you need to clarify the number of iterations, and in "mainGAwsm" which uses Weightes sums method, you need to clarify the weights in the objective function.
